<h2>How to Connect the Steam Deck to a TV or Monitor</h2>

  <p>The Steam Deck isn’t just for handheld gaming — it also works great as a full home console. With a simple cable or dock, you can connect your Steam Deck to a TV or external monitor and play on the big screen with a controller, keyboard, or mouse.</p>

  <h3>What You’ll Need</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Steam Deck</li>
    <li>A USB-C to HDMI adapter, USB-C hub with video out, or the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" target="_blank">official Steam Deck Dock</a></li>
    <li>HDMI cable</li>
    <li>TV or monitor with an available HDMI port</li>
    <li>Optional: External controller, keyboard, or mouse</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Option 1: Use a USB-C to HDMI Adapter</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Plug the USB-C end of the adapter into the top of the Steam Deck</li>
    <li>Connect an HDMI cable from the adapter to your TV or monitor</li>
    <li>Power on the TV and set it to the correct HDMI input</li>
    <li>The Steam Deck should automatically mirror the display</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This is the fastest and cheapest way to get started. Just be sure the adapter supports video out (DisplayPort Alt Mode).</p>

  <h3>Option 2: Use the Steam Deck Dock or a USB-C Hub</h3>
  <p>The official dock adds Ethernet, USB, and power passthrough in addition to HDMI or DisplayPort video. Third-party hubs can work too.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Connect the Dock or hub to power</li>
    <li>Plug the Dock into the Steam Deck via USB-C</li>
    <li>Connect HDMI from Dock to TV</li>
    <li>Turn on the TV and select the correct input</li>
    <li>Use USB ports to plug in a controller, keyboard, or mouse</li>
  </ol>

  <p>You can use this setup for couch gaming, emulation, or even desktop tasks with an external monitor.</p>

  <h3>Tips for Big-Screen Mode</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Change Resolution</strong>: In Desktop Mode, go to <em>Settings → Display</em> to adjust resolution if needed</li>
    <li><strong>Game Mode Scaling</strong>: Most games auto-scale, but adjust per-game resolution if things look off</li>
    <li><strong>Steam Input</strong>: You can use a PS5, Xbox, or Switch Pro controller — wired or wireless</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple Monitors</strong>: In Desktop Mode, use KDE’s display settings to extend or mirror screens</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Can You Charge While Playing on TV?</h3>
  <p>Yes! If using the official Dock or a powered USB-C hub, the Steam Deck will charge while connected. Be sure the power supply is 45W or higher to avoid battery drain while gaming.</p>

  <h3>Best Use Cases</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Playing multiplayer games on the couch with friends</li>
    <li>Using RetroArch, EmuDeck, or Dolphin on the big screen</li>
    <li>Docking your Steam Deck as a full Linux desktop</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Whether you’re gaming, streaming, or multitasking, connecting your Steam Deck to a TV or monitor is easy and turns it into a powerful console-like experience. All you need is the right cable or dock to get started.</p>
