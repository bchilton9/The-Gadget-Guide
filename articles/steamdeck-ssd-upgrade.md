<h2>How to Upgrade the SSD on Steam Deck</h2>

  <p>The Steam Deck comes with 64GB eMMC, 256GB NVMe, or 512GB NVMe storage — all of which can be upgraded with a larger and faster M.2 2230 SSD. This guide walks you through how to do it safely and effectively.</p>

  <h3>⚠️ Disclaimer</h3>
  <p>This process involves opening your Steam Deck and voiding the warranty. Proceed only if you're comfortable working with electronics. If unsure, consult a technician or iFixit professional.</p>

  <h3>🧰 What You’ll Need</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Compatible M.2 2230 NVMe SSD (1TB or 2TB recommended)</li>
    <li>Plastic pry tool</li>
    <li>ESD-safe T5 Torx screwdriver</li>
    <li>MicroSD card or USB drive (for SteamOS recovery)</li>
    <li>SteamOS recovery image from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/" target="_blank">Steam website</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 1: Back Up Your Data</h3>
  <p>All existing data will be wiped during the SSD upgrade. Back up your saves to the cloud or external storage first.</p>

  <h3>Step 2: Power Down and Open the Steam Deck</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Turn off your Steam Deck completely.</li>
    <li>Remove the microSD card (if installed).</li>
    <li>Using the T5 screwdriver, remove the 8 rear screws.</li>
    <li>Gently pry open the back shell with the plastic tool. Take your time — the clips are firm but fragile.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Step 3: Remove the Stock SSD</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Locate the silver EMI shield covering the SSD bay and unscrew it.</li>
    <li>Carefully disconnect the battery using the plastic tool (optional but recommended).</li>
    <li>Unscrew and slide out the original M.2 2230 SSD.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Step 4: Install the New SSD</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Insert the new SSD at an angle and press it flat.</li>
    <li>Screw it in securely using the original mounting screw.</li>
    <li>Reconnect the battery (if disconnected).</li>
    <li>Reinstall the EMI shield and close the case.</li>
    <li>Screw the back panel into place.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Step 5: Reinstall SteamOS</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Insert your SteamOS recovery USB or microSD.</li>
    <li>Power on the Steam Deck while holding <strong>Volume Down</strong> to open the boot manager.</li>
    <li>Select your recovery drive.</li>
    <li>Choose the <strong>Re-image Steam Deck</strong> option and follow the prompts.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>This will completely reinstall SteamOS and format the new SSD. Once it’s done, you’ll be back at the setup screen just like on day one.</p>

  <h3>Step 6: Set Up and Restore Your Games</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Log in to Steam and re-download your games</li>
    <li>Or copy them from backup if you saved them externally</li>
    <li>Reinsert your microSD card (if you have one)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>📏 SSD Compatibility Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>M.2 2230 is the only size that fits — M.2 2242 or 2280 will not work</li>
    <li>Stick to Gen3 or Gen4 NVMe drives</li>
    <li>Popular models: Sabrent Rocket 2230, WD SN740, Corsair MP600 Mini</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Upgrading the SSD is one of the most impactful hardware upgrades for the Steam Deck. With the right tools and patience, you can greatly expand your storage capacity and improve game performance and loading times.</p>
