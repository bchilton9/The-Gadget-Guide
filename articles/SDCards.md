<h2>SD Cards</h2>
  <p>Depending on the model you have, the Steam Deck doesn’t have a lot of storage space. Even the 512GB version will fill up fast with AAA games. Upgrading the internal storage and adding an SD card will increase your storage capacity.</p>

  <p>The internal storage is much faster than the SD card storage. If you can only afford one and are willing to open your system and replace the NVMe card, this is a better option.</p>

  <p>SD cards are still a good option for adding space. Personally, I have done both, and I now have 3TB combined storage (2TB internal and 1TB SD card). I place emulated games and older or smaller games on the SD card and save the internal drive for large AAA titles.</p>

  <p>Note: Any drive or card you buy will not have the full space advertised. My 1TB SD card actually has 916.3GB of usable space.</p>

  <h3>Selecting an SD Card</h3>
  <p><strong>Warning!</strong> There are a lot of fake cards out there. If you find a 1TB SD card on Amazon, eBay, or other sites for $20 to $30 — it's fake. These are usually 32GB–128GB cards formatted to appear as 1TB. When full, they will stop accepting files. If you do get a genuine one that cheap, it's likely poor quality.</p>

  <p>Stick with trusted brands: <strong>SanDisk, Samsung, and Lexar</strong>. I personally prefer Lexar for their balance of quality and price.</p>

  <p>Any SD card will work, but smaller cards fill up fast. I recommend at least 512GB or 1TB models.</p>

  <p>Speed matters too. Look for cards rated <strong>U3 A2</strong> for best results with the Steam Deck.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Class 10:</strong> The base speed rating, showing 10MB/sec minimum write speed. Look for a “C10” symbol on the card.</li>
    <li><strong>U3:</strong> Faster than U1, rated at 30MB/sec. Class 10 is usually U1.</li>
    <li><strong>A2:</strong> Improves performance for app and game installs. Same game performance as A1, but faster downloads (assuming your internet supports it).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Make sure you choose <strong>microSD</strong> format — the only type that fits in the Steam Deck.</p>

  <h3>Recommended SD Cards</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Lexar PLAY U3 A1 1TB:</strong> My top choice. Cheaper than others, and works great.</li>
    <li><strong>SanDisk Extreme U3 A2 1TB:</strong> Top-tier quality, though more expensive than Lexar.</li>
    <li><strong>SanDisk Ultra C10 A1 1.5TB:</strong> Largest capacity available. Slower, but great for massive ROM libraries.</li>
    <li><strong>Lexar PLAY U3 A1 512GB:</strong> Same as the 1TB but half the size.</li>
    <li><strong>Samsung PRO Plus U3 A2 512GB:</strong> High quality, but no 1TB version widely available.</li>
    <li><strong>SanDisk Extreme U3 A2 512GB:</strong> Same as the 1TB version but with less storage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Inserting and Using Your SD Card</h3>
  <p>Insert the microSD card into the slot on the bottom of the Steam Deck. It should click and lock into place. If it doesn’t, try flipping it around. The card should sit flush with the shell.</p>

  <p>Steam will prompt you to format the card. If not, go to <strong>Settings &gt; System</strong> and choose <strong>Format SD Card</strong>.</p>

  <p>When installing a game, Steam will ask where to install it.</p>

  <p>If you're full like I was when installing Ark, you may see a warning — otherwise, you'll be able to select the SD card as a destination.</p>

  <p>In Settings &gt; Storage, both internal and SD card storage will now show. You can move games between drives by pressing <strong>Y</strong>.</p>
