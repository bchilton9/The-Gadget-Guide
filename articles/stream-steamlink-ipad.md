<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Valve's Steam Link app makes it easy to stream your entire PC game library to devices like your iPad. Whether you want to relax on the couch or take your games into another room, this setup lets you enjoy low-latency streaming with full controller support — all without needing additional hardware.</p>

  <h2>What You’ll Need</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gaming PC</strong> or <strong>Steam Deck</strong> with Steam installed and logged in</li>
    <li><strong>iPad</strong> running iPadOS 13.0 or newer</li>
    <li><strong>Steam Link app</strong> from the App Store (free)</li>
    <li><strong>Bluetooth or USB controller</strong> (e.g., Xbox, PS4/PS5, or MFi-certified)</li>
    <li><strong>5GHz Wi-Fi connection</strong> (or Ethernet for PC, if possible)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Setup</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Install Steam Link:</strong> Open the App Store on your iPad, search for "Steam Link", and install it. This app is created by Valve, the same developers behind Steam.</li>
    <li><strong>Enable Streaming on Your PC:</strong> On your gaming PC or Steam Deck, open Steam, click <em>Steam &gt; Settings &gt; Remote Play</em>, and make sure Remote Play is enabled.</li>
    <li><strong>Launch the Steam Link App:</strong> On your iPad, launch Steam Link. It will begin scanning your local network for a host system running Steam.</li>
    <li><strong>Pair Your iPad with Your Host:</strong> When your PC shows up, select it. Steam will display a 4-digit PIN. Enter this PIN on your PC to authenticate the connection.</li>
    <li><strong>Connect a Controller:</strong> Go to your iPads <em>Settings &gt; Bluetooth</em> menu and pair your game controller. Most modern Xbox and PlayStation controllers will connect easily. Launch the Steam Link app again to confirm its detected.</li>
    <li><strong>Test the Connection:</strong> Once connected, Steam Link will run a network test and recommend a streaming quality profile (Fast, Balanced, or Beautiful). Choose the one that best suits your network performance.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Streaming Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use Ethernet:</strong> If possible, connect your PC or Steam Deck to your router via Ethernet. This provides more stable performance than Wi-Fi.</li>
    <li><strong>Adjust Streaming Settings:</strong> In the Steam Link app, go to <em>Settings & Streaming</em> and fine-tune resolution, bitrate, and scaling. Reducing resolution can help with older routers.</li>
    <li><strong>Desktop Mode:</strong> Enable "Stream Desktop" mode in the app settings to access your full Windows environment remotely — useful for non-Steam games or web browsing.</li>
    <li><strong>Limit Background Apps:</strong> Disable other network-heavy apps (like downloads, cloud sync, or video streaming) for smoother gameplay.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Known Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Audio Delay:</strong> Bluetooth audio may experience slight lag. Using the iPad speakers or wired headphones helps reduce this.</li>
    <li><strong>Touch Support:</strong> Steam Link doesn’t currently offer custom touch layouts. A physical controller is recommended for serious gaming.</li>
    <li><strong>No Cross-Network Streaming:</strong> Steam Link works best on a local network. Remote access is possible with VPNs, but not officially supported.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Steam Link Won’t Detect PC:</strong> Ensure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi. Disable VPNs or firewall software temporarily if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Controller Not Working:</strong> Check that it’s paired and supported. Steam Link supports most Xbox, PlayStation, and MFi controllers.</li>
    <li><strong>Frequent Disconnects:</strong> Switch from 2.4GHz to 5GHz Wi-Fi or move closer to the router. You can also reduce resolution for stability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Streaming PC games to your iPad with Steam Link is a fantastic way to bring your favorite titles beyond your desk. With a solid network and controller in hand, you’ll get the best of both worlds: PC-level performance and tablet-level portability.</p>
