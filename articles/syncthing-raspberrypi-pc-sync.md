<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Syncthing offers secure, peer-to-peer synchronization between devices. This guide will walk you through setting up a sync link between a Raspberry Pi and a Windows, Mac, or Linux PC using Syncthing.</p><h2>Step 1: Install Syncthing on Raspberry Pi</h2><ol><li>SSH into your Raspberry Pi or open a terminal.</li><li>Run the following commands:<pre>sudo apt update<br>sudo apt install syncthing</pre></li><li>Enable and start Syncthing as a user service:<pre>systemctl --user enable syncthing<br>systemctl --user start syncthing</pre></li><li>Allow Syncthing to auto-start by adding it to your user's autostart or using systemctl with linger enabled:</li></ol><h2>Step 2: Access Syncthing Web UI</h2><p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://&lt;pi-ip-address&gt;:8384</code>. You should see the Syncthing dashboard.</p><h2>Step 3: Install Syncthing on Your PC</h2><ul><li>Download and install Syncthing from <a href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank">syncthing.net</a>.</li><li>Launch the Syncthing GUI and note your device ID.</li></ul><h2>Step 4: Link the Devices</h2><ol><li>In the Syncthing UI on your Pi, click <strong>Add Remote Device</strong>.</li><li>Enter your PC's device ID, a name (e.g., MyLaptop), and save.</li><li>On your PC, approve the connection request when prompted.</li></ol><h2>Step 5: Create and Share a Folder</h2><ol><li>On either device, click <strong>Add Folder</strong>.</li><li>Give it a unique Folder ID (e.g., <code>documents-sync</code>), select a path, and check the box to share it with the other device.</li><li>On the receiving device, approve the folder and select the local path to sync it to.</li></ol><h2>Tips & Tricks</h2><ul><li>Use versioning on important folders to keep past versions of modified files.</li><li>Set up folder-specific permissions if you're syncing to shared drives.</li><li>Change the default listen port if you're running multiple instances.</li><li>Run Syncthing on a non-standard port if needed (via config.xml).</li></ul><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><ul><li><strong>Web UI not reachable?</strong> Make sure port 8384 is open and not blocked by UFW or your router.</li><li><strong>Device not connecting?</strong> Confirm that both devices are online and have each other's device ID.</li><li><strong>File conflicts?</strong> Enable versioning or manually resolve when notified by Syncthing.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Syncthing makes syncing between a Raspberry Pi and a desktop computer simple, secure, and completely private. Once it's configured, the process runs automatically in the background, keeping your files in sync in real time with minimal maintenance.</p>
