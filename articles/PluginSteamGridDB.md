<p>The plugin will load artwork options for the game. Highlight your desired artwork and press <strong>A</strong> to apply it.</p>

<p>You can choose from several types of artwork:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Capsule</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Wide Capsule</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Hero</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Logo</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Icon</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>When you select an <strong>Icon</strong>, Steam will automatically restart to apply it. Other artwork types do not require a restart.</p>

<h3>4. Manage and Filter</h3>
<p>The <strong>Manage</strong> tab in SteamGridDB will show you the currently applied artwork for the selected game.</p>

<p>Press <strong>X</strong> to open the filter menu. This lets you show or hide content such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Animated artwork</li>
  <li>Adult content</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also change the search term if the game title doesn't return results. This is helpful for non-Steam apps. For example, you might use artwork from <strong>FFXIV</strong> for <strong>XIVLauncher</strong>.</p>
