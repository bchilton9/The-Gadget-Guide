<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>RetroAchievements bring a modern touch to retro gaming by adding unlockable goals for classic games, much like Xbox or PlayStation trophies. Thanks to RetroArch and EmuDeck, you can easily enable this feature on your Steam Deck.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Steam Deck with EmuDeck installed</li>
    <li>RetroArch configured via EmuDeck</li>
    <li>A free <a href="https://retroachievements.org/" target="_blank">RetroAchievements.org</a> account</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 1: Create a RetroAchievements Account</h2>
  <p>Visit <a href="https://retroachievements.org/" target="_blank">https://retroachievements.org/</a> and register for a free account. You'll need this to sync and track your achievements.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Launch RetroArch</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Switch to Desktop Mode on the Steam Deck.</li>
    <li>Open the Start Menu and launch <strong>RetroArch</strong>.</li>
    <li>Once inside, use the D-pad or left joystick to navigate to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Step 3: Enable RetroAchievements</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In Settings, go to <strong>Achievements</strong>.</li>
    <li>Toggle <strong>Enable Achievements</strong> to ON.</li>
    <li>Enter your RetroAchievements username and password.</li>
    <li>Optionally enable:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardcore Mode</strong>: disables save states for extra challenge</li>
        <li><strong>Leaderboards</strong>: compete with others</li>
        <li><strong>Challenge Indicators</strong>: shows progress on-screen</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Step 4: Save Configuration</h2>
  <p>Press the <strong>Start</strong> button (or select from the left-hand menu) and choose <strong>Save Configuration</strong>. This ensures RetroAchievements remains enabled the next time you launch RetroArch.</p>

  <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Only supported cores and games:</strong> Not all games or emulators (cores) are supported. You can check compatibility on the RetroAchievements website.</li>
    <li><strong>Try Hardcore Mode:</strong> Great for competitive players who want authentic difficulty.</li>
    <li><strong>Track Progress:</strong> You can view unlocked achievements on both the Steam Deck and your RetroAchievements profile online.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Can't login:</strong> Double-check your username and password. Remember that it's case-sensitive.</li>
    <li><strong>Achievements not unlocking:</strong> Ensure the ROM is a verified dump and supported by RetroAchievements. Try loading a different core.</li>
    <li><strong>Hardcore mode not working:</strong> Some cores disable certain achievements when save states or cheats are used.</li>
  </ul>
