<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Need to access your OpenMediaVault (OMV) NAS while away from home? With Dynamic DNS (DDNS), you can assign a domain name to your changing home IP address and configure remote access using your router and basic security settings.</p><h2>Step 1: Set Up a DDNS Service</h2><ol><li>Sign up for a free DDNS provider like <a href="https://www.noip.com" target="_blank">No-IP</a> or <a href="https://www.duckdns.org" target="_blank">DuckDNS</a>.</li><li>Create a hostname (e.g., <code>mynas.duckdns.org</code>) and associate it with your home's public IP address.</li><li>Install a DDNS client on your Raspberry Pi or router to automatically update your IP address.</li></ol><h2>Step 2: Configure Port Forwarding</h2><ol><li>Log in to your router's admin page (usually <code>192.168.1.1</code> or similar).</li><li>Find the Port Forwarding section.</li><li>Forward external ports to OMV's internal IP address and services:</li><ul><li><strong>Port 80 or 443</strong> (for HTTP/HTTPS access — be cautious!)</li><li><strong>Port 22</strong> (SSH – optional, but secure only with keys and a custom port)</li><li><strong>Other ports</strong> for services like FTP, SMB, or WebDAV, depending on your use case</li></ul><li>Use your DDNS address (e.g., <code>mynas.duckdns.org</code>) from outside your home to connect.</li></ol><h2>Step 3: Secure Remote Access</h2><ul><li>Use a firewall or fail2ban to block brute-force attempts.</li><li>Disable password login over SSH and use SSH keys instead.</li><li>Set strong admin passwords and regularly update OMV and plugins.</li><li>Consider setting up a reverse proxy with HTTPS using Let's Encrypt (see other articles).</li></ul><h2>Step 4: Test Your Connection</h2><ol><li>Disconnect from your local Wi-Fi (use a mobile hotspot or another internet connection).</li><li>Visit your DDNS URL in a browser (e.g., <code>https://mynas.duckdns.org</code>).</li><li>You should see your OMV login screen if configured correctly.</li></ol><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With Dynamic DNS and proper security precautions, accessing your OpenMediaVault NAS remotely is simple and reliable. Just make sure to keep it secure and monitor login attempts to protect your data.</p>
